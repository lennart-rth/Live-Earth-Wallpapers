## Known Bugs
1. As of June 27, 2023, there are no images available of Goes-17 meteosat-11.
### Pypi
1. If `liewa-cli` or `liewa-gui` is not known, add python pip itepackages to system `PATH`.
### Windows
1. On some systems the task scheduler can't automatically be set to execute the program even when the cumputer is in battery mode. Therefore you have to  uncheck this flag manually in the TaskScheduler for the `liewa` Task.
2. On some systems the python Packages need to be manually installed. Do so by typing `pip install bs4 pillow pyyaml requests` into CMD.
